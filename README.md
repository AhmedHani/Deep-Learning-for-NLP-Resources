# Deep-Learning-for-NLP-Resources
List of resources to get started with Deep Learning for NLP. Listing resources which I found useful while learning the subject (I'll update it incrementally) 

1. https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6Xpj9I5qXYEcOhn7TqghAJ6NAPrNmUBH : This lecture series has very 	 	good introduction to Neural Network and Deep Learning.

2. https://www.coursera.org/course/neuralnets : This lecture series is from Geof Hinton. The concepts 		    explained are bit abstract, concepts are hard to understand in first go. Generally people recommend these 	 lectures as starting point but I am skeptical about it. I would suggest going through 1st one before this.

3. https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE6Wd9FR--EfW8dtjAuPoTuPcqmOV53Fu : Deep Learning Lectures from 		Oxford University 

4. https://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~lisa/pointeurs/TR1312.pdf : This is a short book on Deep Learning written by 	Yoshua Bengio. It deals with theoritical aspects related to Deep Architectures. Great book though.

5. http://www.deeplearningbook.org/ : This web page has a book draft written by Yoshua Bengio and Ian 			Goodfellow. Later person is author of Theano library. This is holy bible on Deep Learning. 

6. http://cs231n.stanford.edu/ : Deep Learning for Vision by Stanford. Useful resources for Deep Learning for Vision.

7. http://videolectures.net/yoshua_bengio/ : Video Lectures By Yoshua Bengio on Theoritical Aspects of Deep 	Learning. They are counterparts of resource [4]. 

8. http://videolectures.net/geoffrey_e_hinton/ : Video Lectures by the GodFather Geoffrey Hinton on 			introduction to Deep Learning and some advanced stuff too.

9. https://github.com/ChristosChristofidis/awesome-deep-learning : Good collection of resources.

10. http://deeplearning.net/reading-list/ : Reading resources

11. http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/csc2515/deeprefs.html : Reading list by Hinton

12. http://videolectures.net/mlss05us_lecun_ebmli/ : Intro to Energy based model by Yann Lecunn.

13. http://videolectures.net/kdd2014_bengio_deep_learning/?q=ICLR# : Yoshua Bengio's lecture series recorded in KDD' 14.

14. http://videolectures.net/nips09_collobert_weston_dlnl/ : Ronan Collobert lecture (it's quite old new, from 2008 but I think it is still useful).

15. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eixGKz0Asr8 : Lecture series by Chris Manning and Richard Socher given at NAACL 2013 

16. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmG4jzmBZ88 : Lecture series for DL4NLP with some practical guidelines.

17. https://blog.wtf.sg/2014/08/24/nlp-with-neural-networks/ : Blogpost on some DL applications.
